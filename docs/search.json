    "section": "8.2 Parametric approach with POT modelling",
    "text": "8.2 Parametric approach with POT modelling\n\n8.2.1 Fit a stationary GP distribution\nAs we have already seen in the previous section, the GP distribution is the most appropriate distribution to model threshold exceedances. As explained by Gilleland & Katz (2016) in their paper, an important additional consideration when using the POT approach is the rate of exceedance — that is, how often values exceed the chosen threshold. While this rate does not affect the fitting of the GP model itself, it is crucial for calculating return levels, which require scaling the model to real-world time units.`\nThe exceedance rate should be passed the time.units argument in the fevd(...) function. Since our goal is to estimate annual return levels, we must specify the average number of threshold exceedances per year (i.e., the average number of flood events per year in our dataset).\nFigure 8 shows that the number of events per year varies — some years experience multiple flood events, while others have none. Therefore, a reasonable approach is to use the empirical average number of exceedances per year over the entire study period as the value for time.units. The snippet below shows how to calculate this rate.\n\n# compute the average number of threshold exceedances per year\npeaks_final$year &lt;- year(peaks_final$Date)\nn_years &lt;- length(unique(peaks_final$year))\nn_events &lt;- nrow(peaks_final)\nunits &lt;- n_events / n_years\n\n# Optional: print it nicely\ncat(\"Average number of events per year:\", round(units, 2), \"\\n\")\n\nAverage number of events per year: 3.71 \n\n\nNow, we can fit our GP model to the POT data. The workflow is same as the block maxima models (GEV and Gumbel), and same tools can be used to estimates the GP parameters. In the chunk below, we use the {extRemes} library again to fit the GP distribution to our partial duration serie in a statinary context.\n\n# fit the stationary GP distribution to the PDS\nlibrary(extRemes)\nthres = 10\nx = peaks_final$Q\nsgp_fit = fevd(x, type=\"GP\", method=\"GMLE\", threshold=thres, time.units = paste0(units,\"/year\"))\n\n# show summary of the fit\npretty_fit_summary(sgp_fit, \"GP\")\n\n=== GP  Fit Summary ===\n\nEstimated Parameters:\n scale  shape \n3.6496 0.3099 \n\nModel Fit Criteria:\nLogLik: -570.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe only thing that change here, comared to the block maxima models, is the additional threshold value and the time.units arguments passed to the fevd(...) function, which is the same as the threshold used in the declustering process. The pretty_fit_summary(...) is defined in the block maxima section.\n\n\nFigure 10 displays the diagnostics from the GP distribution fitted to the partial duration serie: density plot of empirical data and fitted GP df (top-left), and quantiles from a sample drawn from the fitted GP against the empirical data quantiles with 95% confidence bands (top-right).\n\n# show diagnostic plots of the GP distribution fitting\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(sgp_fit, type=\"density\", main=\"(a) Density plot\")\nplot(sgp_fit, type=\"qq2\", main=NULL)\ntitle(main=\"(b) Q-Q plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Diagnostic plots for the General Pareto (GP) distribution fitted to the threshold exceedances serie in a stationary context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Fit a non-stationary GP distribution\nAs for the block maxima models, one way to account for non-stationary is to incorporate covariates within the parameters of the distributions in a regression-like manner. To perform parametric trend detection with the GP distribution, we model the scale parameter (σ) as a function of time, transforming the model into a non-stationary GP. The scale parameter of the non-stationnary GP distribution is computed as follow: \n\\sigma (t) = \\sigma 0 + \\sigma 1·t \\tag{2}\n where \\sigma is the time-dependant scale parameter of the GP distribution, t is the time index, \\sigma 0 is the intercept, and \\sigma 1 is the slope.\nThe chunk below use the {extRemes} library to fit the Non-Stationary GP (NS-GP) distribution to our Partial Duration Serie extracted earlier. Unfortunately, most of the extRemes diagnostic plots currently are not available for non-stationary POT models.\n\n# set threshold\nthres = 10\n\n# use time index for non-stationary context fitting\npeaks_final$scale_cov = 1:nrow(peaks_final)\n\n# fit the GP distribution to the PDS\nPDS = data.frame(peaks_final)\nnsgp_fit = fevd(x=Q, scale.fun=~scale_cov, data=PDS, type=\"GP\", \n                method=\"GMLE\", threshold=thres, time.units=paste0(units,\"/year\"))\n\n# show summary of the fit\npretty_fit_summary(nsgp_fit, \"Non-Stationary GP\")\n\n=== Non-Stationary GP  Fit Summary ===\n\nEstimated Parameters:\n sigma0  sigma1   shape \n 4.1064 -0.0040  0.3066 \n\nModel Fit Criteria:\nLogLik: -570.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNS-GP parameters\n\n\n\nsigma0 = σ0 = 4.1064: is the intercept of the time-varying GP scale parameter. It represents the base scale of the distribution (often the start of the time series).\nsigma1 = σ1 = -0.0040: is the slope of the scale parameter with respect to time. This negative value suggests that extreme values are becoming less variable (narrower tail) over time.\nshape = 0.3066: controls the heaviness of the tail of the GP distribution. The positive value (ξ &gt; 0) suggests a heavy (Fréchet) tail (i.e., the probability of very large exceedances decays slowly).\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Deviance test\nThe non-parametric Mann-Kendall test indicates a non-significant trend in the POT values. With parametric methods, the significance of a temporal trend is based on a deviance test between a non-stationary (or more complex) model and a stationary one. The deviance test, or Likelihood Ratio (LR) test, compares two nested models — a simpler (stationary) model and a more complex (non-stationary) model.\nThe null hypothesis of the deviance test is that the simpler model is sufficient — i.e., no trend (e.g., the GP scale parameter is constant over time). See the Deviance test Section for the mathematical details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe try just to answer this question: Does the more complex non-stationary GP model provide a significantly better fit to the data than the simpler stationary GP model?\n\n\nTo perform the Deviance test, we can use the lr.test(...) of the {extRemes}. This function just requires the previous fitted objects of class “fevd” from the fevd(...) function:\n\nsgp_fit: model with fewer parameters (stationary GP model)\nnsgp_fitmodel with more parameters (non-stationary GP model)\n\n\n# applying the Deviance test\nlr.test(x=sgp_fit, y=nsgp_fit, alpha=0.05, df=1)\n\n\n    Likelihood-ratio Test\n\ndata:  xQ\nLikelihood-ratio = 0.64953, chi-square critical value = 3.8415, alpha =\n0.0500, Degrees of Freedom = 1.0000, p-value = 0.4203\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n🚫 We fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nD-statistic (0.65) much smaller than the critical value (3.84).\np-value (0.4203) much larger than the significance level (0.05)."

Recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), it is simple and requires no assumptions about data distribution, which is particularly advantageous for hydroclimatic series that are rarely normally distributed. Additionally, outlier values have very little influence on the results. The Mann-Kendall test statistic S is defined as:\n\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \\text{sgn}(x_j - x_i) \\tag{1}\n\nThe sign function sgn()) is given by:\n\n\\text{sgn}(x_j - x_i) =\n\\begin{cases}\n+1 & \\text{if } (x_j - x_i) &gt; 0 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } (x_j - x_i) = 0 \\\\\n-1 & \\text{if } (x_j - x_i) &lt; 0\n\\end{cases} \\tag{2}\n\nwhere x_i and x_j are values of the variable at time i and j, respectively, and n is the total number of observations.\nA significance level (commonly \\alpha = 0.05) and the trend slope indicating the direction and magnitude of the trend are key characteristics of the Mann-Kendall test. If n &gt; 8, the test statistic S approximates a normal distribution. In this case, the mean of S is zero and its variance is:\n\n\\text{var}(S) = \\frac{n(n - 1)(2n + 5)}{18} \\tag{3}\n\nThe standardized test statistic Z, which indicates the direction of the trend, is calculated as:\n\nZ =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{S - 1}{\\sqrt{\\text{var}(S)}} & \\text{if } S &gt; 0 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } S = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{S + 1}{\\sqrt{\\text{var}(S)}} & \\text{if } S &lt; 0\n\\end{cases} \\tag{4}\n\nThe null hypothesis H_0 (no trend) is rejected if |Z| &gt; 1.96 at the 95% confidence level.\n\nA positive trend is significant if Z &gt; 1.96\nA negative trend is significant if Z &lt; -1.96\n\nWe use the mk.test(...) function from {trend} package to perform the MK test at the 0.05 significance level to test the hypothesis that there is no stationarity in the maximum annual floods serie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNon-Stationarity (NS) refers to changes in statistical properties over time.\n\n\n\nmktest &lt;- trend::mk.test(extractedAMF$AMAX)\nprint(mktest)\n\n\n    Mann-Kendall trend test\n\ndata:  extractedAMF$AMAX\nz = -1.231, n = 60, p-value = 0.2183\nalternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\n            S          varS           tau \n -194.0000000 24581.3333333    -0.1096665 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\n\np.value = 0.2183: there is not enough statistical evidence to conclude that a significant trend exists in the AMF serie.\ntau = -0.1096665: Kendall’s Tau is a non-parametric measure of trend strength, ranging from -1 (perfect decreasing trend) to +1 (perfect increasing trend). A value near 0 indicates a weak or no trend.\nz = -1.231: the calculated test statistic (a z-score). A negative value suggests a potential decreasing trend, while a positive value suggests a potential increasing trend.\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the evolution of the AMF over time and a red line indicating the overall linear trend.

Sen’s algorithm looks at every pair of data points, calculates the slope between them, then uses the the median of all those slopes as the estimated trend.\n\n\\beta = \\text{median} \\left( \\frac{x_j - x_i}{j - i} \\right), \\quad , ∀\\quad j &gt; i \\tag{5}\n\nTo express the Sen’s slope as a percentage change over the period, it can be normalized by the mean:\n\n\\%\\beta = \\left( N \\cdot \\frac{\\beta}{\\bar{x}} \\right) \\times 100 \\tag{6}\n where \\%\\beta is the relative trend rate over the period, and \\bar{x} represents the mean value of the variable across the period, N is the number of data points (i.e., the length of period).\nThe Sen’s slope can be easily computed using the sens.slope(...) function from the {trend} package, as in the chunk below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSen slope\n\n\n\nSlope = -0.1187375 : the median trend is slightly negative, suggesting a weak decline of -0.11 \\quad mm/year.\np-value = 0.2183: this negative trend is not statistically significant.\n\n\n\n# compute Sen's slope and intercept\nsenslope &lt;- trend::sens.slope(x = extractedAMF$AMAX)\nprint(senslope)\n\n\n    Sen's slope\n\ndata:  extractedAMF$AMAX\nz = -1.231, n = 60, p-value = 0.2183\nalternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.3115676  0.0768529\nsample estimates:\nSen's slope \n -0.1187375 \n\n\nYet, the sens.slope(...) function returns the absolute slope (i.e., the median change per time unit). It is more meaningful to express the trend as a relative percentage change over the time period.\nTo do this, we define a wrapper function that calculates the Sen’s slope and then converts it into a relative trend rate.\n\n\nShow the code\nsens_slope_percent &lt;- function(x, time_step = NULL) {\n    #' Compute Sen's slope as a percentage change over the full time period\n    #' @param x A numeric vector of observations\n    #' @param time_step Optional (e.g., year) used for display purpose only\n    #' @return Relative percent change over the period\n\n    require(trend)\n\n    N &lt;- length(x)\n    result &lt;- sens.slope(x)\n    slope &lt;- result$estimates # Absolute slope (per time unit)\n    p_val &lt;- result$p.value # p-value for trend test\n    mean_val &lt;- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n    percent_change &lt;- (N * slope) / mean_val * 100\n\n    cat(\"Absolute Sen's slope: \", round(slope, 4), \"\\n\", sep = \"\")\n    cat(\"P-value: \", format.pval(p_val, digits = 4), \"\\n\", sep = \"\")\n    cat(\"Relative trend rate: \", round(percent_change, 2), \"%/\", \"\\n\", sep = \"\")\n}\n\n\nNow, we can compute the relative Sen’s slope for the annual maximum flow data:\n\n# compute Sen's slope as a percentage change\nsens_slope_percent(extractedAMF$AMAX, time_step = \"year\")\n\nAbsolute Sen's slope: -0.1187\nP-value: 0.2183\nRelative trend rate: -23.97%/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative Sen’s slope\n\n\n\nThe annual maximum flow shows a decreasing trend of −24% relative to its long-term average."

This prior helps avoid unrealistic or extreme negative values of the shape parameter, leading to more reliable and stable parameter estimates when data are limited (See Martins & Stedinger (2000) for more details).\n\n\nThe advantage of using GMLE and MLE over the L-moments method is that L-moments are limited in their ability to accommodate non-stationary processes. In contrast, GMLE and MLE can directly incorporate covariates or time trends, making them more flexible and suitable for analyzing data where the underlying distribution may change over time or as a function of external variables. This flexibility is especially important for trend detection."

To perform parametric trend detection, we model the location parameter (μ) as a function of time, transforming the models into non-stationary distributions. The location parameter of the non-stationnary GEV and Gumbel is computed as follow: \n\\mu (t) = \\mu 0 + \\mu 1·t \\tag{11}\n where \\mu (t) is the time-dependant location parameter, t is the time index, \\mu 0 is the intercept, and \\mu 1 is the slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend?\n\n\n\nThe decision to adopt a non-stationary (or more complex) model in FFA depends on whether the temporal trend is statistically significant.\nThe deviance test, based on likelihood ratio statistic (Coles, 2001), offers a formal approach to test this hypothesis by comparing the stationary and non-stationary models.\n\n\n\n6.4.2.2.1 Creating covariate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs mentionned above, we use time index to account for trend in the AMF serie. We create in this chunk above a new column, TimeIndex, to be used as covariate.\n\n\n\n# add time index to use for non-stationary context fitting\nextractedAMF[[\"TimeIndex\"]] = 1:nrow(extractedAMF)\nhead(tibble(extractedAMF), 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n   Year Date        AMAX TimeIndex\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1  1958 1958-12-20  40.0         1\n2  1959 1959-03-07  36.9         2\n3  1960 1960-10-06  58.4         3\n4  1961 1961-12-11  18.4         4\n5  1962 1962-03-05  19.5         5\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2.2.2 Non-Stationary GEV fitting\nThe chunk below use the {extRemes} library to fit the Non-Stationary GEV (NS-GEV) distribution to the Annual Maximum Floods extracted earlier.\n\n# fit the GEV distribution to the AMF\nextractedAMF = data.frame(extractedAMF)\nnsgevfit = fevd(x=AMAX, location.fun=~TimeIndex, data=extractedAMF, type=\"GEV\", method=\"GMLE\")\n\nNow, we will print the results of the fit, using the pretty_fit_summary() function we have defined above. This will show the AIC and BIC values, as well as the estimated parameters of the fitted NS-GEV distribution.\n\n# show fitting sumary\nnsgevfit_res = pretty_fit_summary(nsgevfit, \"GEV\")\n\n=== GEV  Fit Summary ===\n\nEstimated Parameters:\n    mu0     mu1   scale   shape \n20.5045 -0.0276  9.9322  0.3576 \n\nModel Fit Criteria:\nLogLik: 244.55\nAIC: 497.11\nBIC: 505.48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the parameters?\n\n\n\n\nmu0 = μ0 = 20.5045: is the intercept of the time-varying location parameter. It represents the baseline magnitude of the annual maximum flood (AMF) at the starting point of the time serie.\nmu1 = μ1 = –0.0276: is the slope of the location parameter with respect to time. It indicates a decreasing trend in the location (i.e., central tendency) of the AMF over time. Specifically, for each unit increase in time (i.e., each year), the location parameter decreases by 0.0276\\,mm. This suggests that the typical magnitude of extreme floods has been gradually declining over the observation period.\n\n\n\nFinally, we show in Figure 7, the diagnostics from the NS-GEV distribution fitted to the Annual Maximum Floods: density plot of empirical data and fitted GEV df (top-left), quantiles from a sample drawn from the fitted GEV against the empirical data quantiles with 95% confidence bands (top-right).\n\n# show diagnostic plots of the GEV distribution fitting\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(nsgevfit, type=\"density\", main=\"(a) Density plot\", ylim=c(0, .4))\nplot(nsgevfit, type=\"qq2\", main=NULL)\ntitle(main=\"(b) Q-Q plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Diagnostic plots for the Non-Stationary Generalized Extreme Value (NS-GEV) distribution fitted to the Annual Maximum Flood (AMF) series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2.2.3 Deviance test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical of the deviance test\n\n\n\nAs mentionned above, The Deviance test, or Likelihood Ratio (LR) test, compares two nested models — typically, a simpler (stationary) model and a more complex (non-stationary) model. It helps determine if introducing additional parameters (such as a time-varying location parameter in a GEV model) leads to a statistically significant improvement in model fit.\n\nD = 2{log(ML_{NSGEV}) - log(ML_{SGEV})}\n\\tag{12}\n\nD represents the deviance test statistic value (D-statistic), log(ML_{NSGEV}) and log(ML_{SGEV}) are the maximised log-likelihood functions of the NSGEV and the SGEV, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog-likelihood function\n\n\n\nThe likelihood function itself measures how well a statistical model explains observed data by giving, for a set of parameters, the probability (or probability density) of observing the data under the model.\n\n\nTo perform the Deviance test, we can use the lr.test(...) of the {extRemes}. This function just requires the previous fitted objects of class “fevd” from the fevd(...) function:\n\ngevfit: model with fewer parameters (stationary GEV model)\nnsgevfitmodel with more parameters (non-stationary GEV model)\n\nThe null hypothesis of the Deviance test is that simpler model is sufficient — i.e., no trend (e.g., the location parameter μ is constant over time). Letting c.alpha be the (1 - alpha) quantile of the chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of model parameters, the null hypothesis that D = 0 is rejected if D &gt; c.alpha (i.e., in favor of model Non-Stationary GEV model).\n\n# applying the Deviance test\nlr.test(x=gevfit, y=nsgevfit, alpha=0.05, df=1)\n\n\n    Likelihood-ratio Test\n\ndata:  extractedAMF$AMAXAMAX\nLikelihood-ratio = 0.20007, chi-square critical value = 3.8415, alpha =\n0.0500, Degrees of Freedom = 1.0000, p-value = 0.6547\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n🚫 We fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nD-statistic (0.20) much smaller than the critical value (3.84).\np-value (0.6547) much larger than the significance level (0.05).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend significance\n\n\n\nThere is no significant evidence that the Non-Stationary GEV model (with a time-varying location parameter) provides a better fit than the stationary model. The trend is not statistically significant (p = 0.6547)."
