It is typically based on the study of observed annual maximum flood discharges over several years. An alternative approach is the peak over threshold (POT) method, which considers all flood peaks that exceed a certain threshold, rather than only the annual maxima. This method allows for a more detailed analysis of extreme flood events by using more data points above the chosen threshold.\n\nThe objective is to determine the discharge associated with a return period, that is, the discharge that has a certain probability (e.g., 1%, 10%) of being exceeded in any given year. For example, a 100-year flood has a 1% chance of being exceeded in any year.\n\nTo achieve this, the data are fitted to a probability distribution (such as the Gumbel distribution), and a frequency curve is constructed linking discharges to return periods. This curve is then used to design hydraulic structures (dams, bridges, levees) and to manage flood risks.\n\nFrequency analysis thus allows for an objective assessment of flood-related risks and supports informed decision-making in land-use planning and flood protection.\n\n\n## [Extreme Value Theory (EVT)]{.custom-tabset-title}\n\nImagine we have daily observational data for a random variable (e.g., river discharges, precipitations, etc.) for many years. [EVT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory) suggests that the extreme values of this variable are asymptotically close to one of three types of extreme value distributions, regardless of the original distribution of daily flows. \n\nThe EVD helps us estimate the probability of rare, high-flow events like floods.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-screen layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(a) Normal distribution of the random variable](index_files/figure-ipynb/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(b) Sampling distribution of the mean](index_files/figure-ipynb/unnamed-chunk-1-2.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(c) Extreme value distribution (maxima)](index_files/figure-ipynb/unnamed-chunk-1-3.png)\n:::\n\nIllustration of the Extreme Value Theory (EVT)\n:::\n\n\n\n## [Practical Objectives]{.custom-tabset-title}\n\n📊 **Apply sampling approaches for extreme events**\n\nUse annual maxima and peaks-over-threshold (POT) methods, including threshold selection and declustering to identify independent events.\n\n📈 **Understand trend detection in extreme rainfall or flood series**\n\nGain insight into statistical methods for identifying trends in hydrometeorological extremes.\n\n🧪 **Compare non-parametric and parametric techniques**\n\nImplement and contrast the non-parametric test (e.g., Mann-Kendall) with parametric (distribution-based) models such as Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GEV) and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) in a non-stationary framework.\n\n🔍 **Interpret statistical significance**\n\nEvaluate the reliability and meaning of trend detection results under various statistical assumptions.\n\n💻 **Use open-source R packages for implementation**\n\nApply all methods in practice using reproducible, open-source tools within the [R environment](https://www.r-project.org/).\n\n\n## [Materials]{.custom-tabset-title}\n\n📦 [{extRemes}](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v072i08) — For fitting and analyzing extreme value distributions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"extRemes\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n📦 [{trend}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/trend/index.html) — Provides non-parametric tests test for trend detection.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"trend\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n📦 [{dplyr}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) — For data manipulation and tidy workflows\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n📦 [{ggplot2}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) — For creating clear and publication-quality plots\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe packages `dplyr` and `ggplot2` are part of the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) collection of R packages.
