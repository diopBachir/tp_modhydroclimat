It focuses on understanding the frequency and intensity of extreme events.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## 📌 Key Concepts of EVA\n\n📈 **Block Maxima Approach**: Selects the maximum value in fixed time blocks (e.g., annual maximum flow or rainfall) → Fits data to distributions like Gumbel or GEV.\n\n📉 **Peak Over Threshold (POT) Method**: Considers all events exceeding a predefined threshold\n    → More data points → Fitted to Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## 🎯 Objectives of EVA\n\n🔁 **Estimate Return Periods**: Quantify the magnitude of events expected to occur once every N years (e.g., a 100-year event has a 1% annual exceedance probability).\n\n📊 **Construct Frequency Curves**: Fit statistical distributions (e.g., GEV, Gumbel, Log-Pearson Type III) to observed extremes to relate event magnitude to exceedance probability.\n\n🧰 **Support Risk-Based Design**: Inform engineering design criteria (e.g., for dams, levees, drainage systems) based on scientifically justified extreme thresholds\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## 🏗️ Real-world Applications of EVA\n\n🏞️ **Infrastructure Design:** Design dams, bridges, culverts based on expected extreme flows.\n\n💧 **Water Resource Management:** Plan for droughts, reservoir operations, and sustainable use.\n\n⚠️ **Risk Assessment & Planning:** Develop floodplain zoning, disaster risk reduction strategies.\n\n🧭 **Policy & Climate Adaptation:** Inform government strategies and early warning systems in a changing climate.\n:::\n\n\n## [Extreme Value Theory (EVT)]{.custom-tabset-title}\n\nImagine we have daily observational data for a random variable (e.g., river discharges, precipitations, etc.) for many years. [EVT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory) suggests that the extreme values of this variable are asymptotically close to one of three types of extreme value distributions, regardless of the original distribution of daily flows. [EVT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory) helps us estimate the probability of rare, high-flow events like floods.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(a) Normal distribution of the random variable](overview_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(b) Sampling distribution of the mean](overview_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(c) Extreme value distribution (maxima)](overview_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\nIllustration of the Extreme Value Theory (EVT)\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n::: {.callout-important}\n**Independance (absence of autocorrelation)** and **Stationarity** of extreme value time series are the underlying assumptions of EVA.\n:::\n:::\n\n## [Practical Objectives]{.custom-tabset-title}\n\n📊 **Apply sampling approaches for extreme events**\n\nUse annual maxima and peaks-over-threshold (POT) methods, including threshold selection and declustering to identify independent events.\n\n📈 **Understand trend detection in extreme streamflow series**\n\nGain insight into statistical methods for identifying trends in hydrometeorological extremes.\n\n🧪 **Compare non-parametric and parametric techniques**\n\nImplement and contrast the non-parametric test (e.g., Mann-Kendall) with parametric (distribution-based) models such as Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GEV) and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) in a non-stationary framework.\n\n🔍 **Interpret statistical significance**\n\nEvaluate the reliability and meaning of trend detection results under various statistical assumptions.\n\n💻 **Use open-source R packages for implementation**\n\nApply all methods in practice using reproducible, open-source tools within the [R environment](https://www.r-project.org/).\n\n:::\n",
