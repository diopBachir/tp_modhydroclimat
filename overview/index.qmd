# EVA: Extreme Value Analysis

## 🌊 EVA in Hydrology

EVA is a powerful statistical tool to analyze rare events in hydrology and climate science. It focuses on understanding the frequency and intensity of extreme events.

## 📌 Key Concepts of EVA

### 📈 Block Maxima Approach
Selects the maximum value in fixed time blocks (e.g., annual maximum flow or rainfall) → Fits data to distributions like Gumbel or GEV.

### 📉 Peak Over Threshold (POT) Method
Considers all events exceeding a predefined threshold → More data points → Fitted to Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).

## 🎯 Objectives of EVA

🔁 **Estimate Return Periods**: Assess the intensity of rare events expected to be exceeded, on average, once every N years (e.g., for example, a 100-year event corresponds to a 1% annual probability of being exceeded).

📊 **Construct Frequency Curves**: Fit statistical distributions (e.g., GEV, Gumbel, Log-Pearson Type III) to observed extremes to relate event magnitude to exceedance probability.

🧰 **Support Risk-Based Design**: Inform engineering design criteria (e.g., for dams, levees, drainage systems) based on scientifically justified extreme thresholds

## 🏗️ Real-world Applications of EVA

🏞️ **Infrastructure Design:** Design dams, bridges, culverts based on expected extreme flows.

💧 **Water Resource Management:** Plan for droughts, reservoir operations, and sustainable use.

⚠️ **Risk Assessment & Planning:** Develop floodplain zoning, disaster risk reduction strategies.

🧭 **Policy & Climate Adaptation:** Inform government strategies and early warning systems in a changing climate.

Imagine we have daily observational data for a random variable (e.g., river discharges, precipitations, etc.) for many years. [EVT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory) suggests that the extreme values of this variable are asymptotically close to one of three types of extreme value distributions, regardless of the original distribution of daily flows. [EVT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory) helps us estimate the probability of rare, high-flow events like floods.

# Practical Objectives of this Module

📊 **Apply sampling approaches for extreme events**

Use annual maxima and peaks-over-threshold (POT) methods, including threshold selection and declustering to identify independent events.

📈 **Understand trend detection in extreme streamflow series**

Gain insight into statistical methods for identifying trends in hydrometeorological extremes.

🧪 **Compare non-parametric and parametric techniques**

Implement and contrast the non-parametric test (e.g., Mann-Kendall) with parametric (distribution-based) models such as Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GEV) and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) in a non-stationary framework.

🔍 **Interpret statistical significance**

Evaluate the reliability and meaning of trend detection results under various statistical assumptions.

💻 **Use open-source R packages for implementation**

Apply all methods in practice using reproducible, open-source tools within the [R environment](https://www.r-project.org/).
